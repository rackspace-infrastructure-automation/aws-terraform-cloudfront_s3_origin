# aws-terraform-cloudfront_s3_origin

This modules creates an AWS CloudFront distribution with S3 origin

## Basic Usage

```
module "cloudfront_s3_origin" {
 source              = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-cloudfront_s3_origin//?ref=v0.0.3"
 domain_name         = "${aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_s3bucket.bucket_regional_domain_name}"
 origin_id           = "${random_string.cloudfront_rstring.result}"
 enabled             = true
 comment             = "This is a test comment"
 default_root_object = "index.html"

 # logging config
 # Bucket must already exist, can't be generated as a resource along with example.
 # This is a TF bug.
 # The bucket name must be the full bucket ie bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
 bucket = "mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com"

 prefix         = "myprefix"
 bucket_logging = true

 aliases = ["testdomain.testing.example.com"]

 # Origin access id
 origin_access_identity = "${aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity.origin_access_identity.cloudfront_access_identity_path}"

 # default cache behavior
 allowed_methods  = ["GET", "HEAD"]
 cached_methods   = ["GET", "HEAD"]
 path_pattern     = "*"
 target_origin_id = "${random_string.cloudfront_rstring.result}"

 # Forwarded Values
 query_string = false

 #Cookies
 forward = "none"

 viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
 default_ttl            = "3600"

 price_class = "PriceClass_200"

 # restrictions
 restriction_type = "whitelist"
 locations        = ["US", "CA", "GB", "DE"]

 # Certificate
 cloudfront_default_certificate = true
}
```
