# aws-terraform-cloudfront\_s3\_origin

This modules creates an AWS CloudFront distribution with S3 origin
### Enable Logging  
If you enable logging the bucket must already exist. You will get an error if you try  
to use a dynamic bucket like `"${aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_log_s3bucket.bucket_domain_name}"`.  
You must use something like `bucket = "MyExistingbucket"`.

## Basic Usage

```
module "cloudfront_s3_origin" {
  source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-cloudfront_s3_origin//?ref=v0.12.1"

  allowed_methods                 = ["GET", "HEAD"]
  bucket_logging                  = false
  cached_methods                  = ["GET", "HEAD"]
  cloudfront_default_certificate  = true
  comment                         = "This is a test comment"
  default_root_object             = "index.html"
  default_ttl                     = 3600
  domain_name                     = aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_s3bucket.bucket_regional_domain_name
  enabled                         = true
  forward                         = "none"
  locations                       = ["US", "CA", "GB", "DE"]
  origin_access_identity          = aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identity.origin_access_identity.cloudfront_access_identity_path
  origin_access_identity_provided = true
  origin_id                       = random_string.cloudfront_rstring.result
  path_pattern                    = "*"
  price_class                     = "PriceClass_200"
  query_string                    = false
  restriction_type                = "whitelist"
  target_origin_id                = random_string.cloudfront_rstring.result
  viewer_protocol_policy          = "redirect-to-https"

  custom_error_response = [
    {
      error_code            = 404
      error_caching_min_ttl = 30
    },
    {
      error_code            = 403
      error_caching_min_ttl = 30
      response_code         = 200
      response_page_path    = "/error_page.html"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Terraform 0.12 upgrade

Several changes were made while adding terraform 0.12 compatibility.  
The main change to be aware of is the `customer_header` variable  
changed types from `list(string)` to `list(map(string))` to properly function with dynamic  
configuration blocks.

## AWS Provider 3.0 upgrade

Due to the property renaming, `active_trusted_signers` is now `trusted_signers` and the  
underlying property is an attribute driven map instead of the original list format

## Providers
